## Repository Overview

This repository hosts the **R scripts** and data for analyzing global patterns of phenotypic plasticity syndromes across functional traits of the cosmopolitan grass *Phragmites australis*. The workflow covers trait standardization, computation of plasticity indices (e.g., lnRR/DPI), multivariate clustering of trait plasticity, climate–plasticity modeling, and projections under future climate scenarios.

For comprehensive results and methodological details, please refer to our study:
